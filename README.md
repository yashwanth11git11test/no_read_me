# Tumor Detection using CNN
### Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect tumors from medical images. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

### Key Features

Data Processing: Organizes and preprocesses images into train, validation, and test sets.

**CNN Model**: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, MaxPooling, Dense layers, and Dropout for classification.

Data Augmentation: Random flipping, rotation, zoom, translation, and contrast adjustment for robust training.

Visualization: Plots training accuracy/loss and shows predictions with correct/wrong classifications.

Prediction Pipeline: End-to-end system for predicting tumor presence.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Version Control: Git & GitHub

I
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

Organize your dataset in images/train, images/validation, images/test.

Run the preprocessing script to split and label images.

Train the model

Evaluate and visualize results

Model accuracy and loss over epochs are plotted.

Predictions are visualized with correct (green) and wrong (red) classifications.

## Note

The model is continuously being updated to improve its accuracy and performance. Future updates aim to achieve higher precision in tumor detection.
